                     Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sprawling Western tale of
                     loyalty, conviction, and the price of infamy, chronicling
                     the inevitable collapse of a motley crew of Wild West
                     holdouts kicking against the slow march of civilisation and
                     industrialisation. Set in Rockstar’s most authentic and
                     lived-in open world ever, there are so many things to do,
                     so many people to meet, and so many places to explore it’s
                     giddily overwhelming. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn’t just
                     Rockstar’s greatest achievement to date; it’s a game so
                     lacking in compromise it’s tough to know where best to
                     start discussing it. So let’s start at the beginning: It’s
                     1899 and American outlaws are an endangered species. Dutch
                     van der Linde and his gang are on the run after a botched
                     heist in the growing town of Blackwater and they’ve
                     retreated high into the mountains where an atrocious
                     blizzard is covering their escape. We slip into the spurs
                     of Arthur Morgan, an exceedingly cool and capable outlaw
                     who was found by Dutch as a boy and raised on the wrong
                     side of the law, and settle in for a roughly 60-hour story.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     It’s a self-contained and linear introduction but it’s a
                     clever one. The slick cinematics make a hell of first
                     impression, embedding you in the gang and bringing you
                     right up close to the characters who are doing their best
                     to bellow over the howling wind. It also placed me in a
                     distraction-free bubble while I learned some of Red Dead
                     Redemption 2’s early controls and systems, which heightened
                     the impact of having the full map open up to me a few hours
                     later. The conditions on the mountain are almost
                     claustrophobic, with visibility at a premium and thick snow
                     trapping Arthur’s feet. Being set loose in the true open
                     world after toughing it out in this intentionally
                     oppressive environment really underscores the incredible
                     feeling of freedom the full map offers.

                  <h2 class="secondary-text">The Big Country</h2>
                  <p>
                     And what a world it is; broader, more beautiful, and more
                     varied than the one we explored in 2010’s Red Dead
                     Redemption by a massive margin (though parts of that game’s
                     map are also included). There are snowy peaks and dank,
                     alligator-infested swamps. Thick forests and open plateaus.
                     Quaint homesteads and grand plantations. Narrow streams and
                     great lakes. Dusty gulches and dim caves. There’s the muddy
                     livestock town of Valentine, with its wooden buildings and
                     rustic charm, and then there’s the imposing city of Saint
                     Denis, a grimy and growing metropolis full of modern
                     extravagances like electric trams, paved roads, and Chinese
                     restaurants. The vast assortment of ecosystems and
                     environments seamlessly stitched together here is nothing
                     short of remarkable. Red Dead Redemption 2 does an
                     exceptional job at slowly rationing out reasons to visit
                     every corner of its huge world, too. I was still led to
                     areas of the map I hadn’t yet visited even in the closing
                     stages of its 60-hour main storyline. Because so many cards
                     are kept up its sleeve, the joy of discovering new parts of
                     the world is maintained throughout. The ability of this
                     game to keep itself fresh after so many hours is
                     extraordinary, and not entirely due to just the size and
                     diversity of the world; it’s how alive all of those places
                     feel. While the largely rural world of Red Dead Redemption
                     2 is far less dense than the likes of Grand Theft Auto V,
                     it’s absolutely brimming with wildlife to discover, people
                     to interact with (and potentially help), and places to
                     scrutinise. The best kind of open worlds are those that
                     seem almost indifferent to your presence in them; like life
                     goes on whether you stick your nose into proceedings or
                     not. I’ve sat and watched lumberjacks felling trees at a
                     bustling logging camp and curiously tailed a perturbed
                     Englishman wandering around town looking for his mate
                     “Gav.” None of this is crucial to the progression of
                     Arthur’s story; it just helps build a world around him that
                     made me feel like a visitor rather than the centre of the
                     universe. Red Dead Redemption 2 nails this in a way that
                     few – if any – games have before.

                  <p>
                     The slower pace of Red Dead Redemption 2 compared to
                     something like the slightly more breakneck GTA V is also a
                     big part of how it encouraged me to drink in all the world
                     has to offer. Bodies have to be manually looted, and Arthur
                     needs to physically manhandle a body to do so.
                     Single-action pistols need to be cocked before firing. Guns
                     Arthur isn’t currently carrying need to retrieved from his
                     saddle. Coffee needs to be brewed before drinking it.
                     <br />
                     I suspect some folk may regard this sort of stuff as
                     chore-like, but I really dig it. There’s something
                     methodical about it that really helps ground Arthur in the
                     world, rather than have him feel like he’s gliding through
                     it. For instance, I love the deliberate and mechanical
                     process of cycling a new cartridge with a lever-action
                     rifle via a second pull of the fire button – you can even
                     pause for dramatic effect halfway through. Rockstar’s
                     designers didn’t need to factor that in but I think they
                     understand that tiny, almost trivial instances of subtle
                     control like this subconsciously seat me into the world as
                     Arthur even more.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     The unhurried pace of checking vanquished enemies for
                     goodies is an interesting design decision but I quite like
                     the risk versus reward loot loop, to be honest. Do I dart
                     around and pickpocket a dozen dead guys or do I just get
                     the hell out of Dodge? They’re consequences you have to be
                     prepared to accept either because your attention is needed
                     elsewhere or because lingering around the scene of a crime
                     naturally puts you at further risk of being discovered.
                     Bounties don’t always come cheap. Did one of those fellas
                     have a gold nugget in his trousers? Perhaps you’ll never
                     know.
                     <br />
                     <br />
                     About my only major logistical gripe is that the weapons I
                     was previously carrying are regularly swapped out for
                     others. Oftentimes it’s clearly mission-related to ensure
                     you go into a task with a scoped rifle or bow when
                     required, which is fine. More irksome are the times I end
                     up with mismatching pistols for dual wielding, with the
                     game trading out my preference. The admittedly brief bit of
                     time it takes to swap back did elicit the occasional
                     grumble from me. “ I spent a good deal of time off-mission
                     simply moseying around, bingeing on the world like a
                     virtual museum At any rate, it’s seriously worth settling
                     into the pace Rockstar is trying to set here because
                     there’s just so much to see and hear. You’ll hear unique,
                     one-time conversations that occur in camp after certain
                     missions, as well as other bespoke bits of dialogue that
                     reference recent events. Strolling through camp, I’ve been
                     privy to everything from a heated bust-up between John
                     Marston and his partner, Abigail, to the good-natured con
                     man Hosea Matthews regaling the young Jack Marston with
                     stories of his latest fishing adventure. This is all
                     happening around Arthur whether you pause to eavesdrop or
                     not. It makes the camp feel like a concentrated version of
                     the world at large, a place with people going about their
                     business and interacting with one another completely
                     independently of you. I can’t understate the genuine
                     feeling of life this injects into the overall experience
                     for me. Elsewhere in the world there’s still plenty for
                     those who care to stop and smell the roses. Newspapers sold
                     on street corners touch on the aftermath of Arthur’s
                     exploits, as well as other things going on around the
                     world. Much like in GTA V, you can visit theatres and take
                     in some old timey entertainment. Dogs can be patted. I
                     spent a good deal of time off-mission simply moseying
                     around, bingeing on the world like a virtual museum.
                     There’s simply too much to list.
